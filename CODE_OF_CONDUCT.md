# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Furthermore, this project is dedicated to the creation of a high-quality, beneficial dataset for advancing machine learning. All contributions and interactions must adhere to the following foundational principles:
*   **Ethics:** We commit to the highest ethical standards in our work and collaborations.
*   **Equity and Inclusion:** We strive to create an environment where all individuals feel valued and can participate fully.
*   **Nonmaleficence:** We are obligated to "do no harm." Contributions must not be designed to produce malicious, harmful, or unsafe code.
*   **Beneficence:** We aim to "do good." Contributions should be constructive and aligned with the project's goal of creating a valuable educational resource.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
*   Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
*   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
*   Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
*   Focusing on what is best for the community and the project
*   Showing appreciation for the time and effort of other contributors

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
*   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
*   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
*   Public or private harassment
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

A critical form of unacceptable behavior in this project is the **intentional submission of low-quality or malicious patterns**. This includes, but is not limited to, submitting patterns that generate code with security vulnerabilities, obfuscated or intentionally confusing logic, or content that violates our core ethical principles.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement and Consequences

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at **[Exorobourii@gmail.com]**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Actions

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1.  **Correction:** A private, written warning from the project team, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

2.  **Warning:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

3.  **Temporary Ban:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.

4.  **Permanent Ban:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the project community.

### Content-Specific Enforcement

In line with our core principles, the following enforcement actions will be taken regarding contributions:
*   Any `.yaml` pattern file or pull request that is found to violate the principles of Ethics, Equity, Inclusion, Nonmaleficence, or Beneficence **will be rejected and closed without comment.**
*   Repeated or egregious attempts to pollute the pattern pool with malicious, harmful, or unethical content **will result in an immediate and permanent ban** from all project spaces.
