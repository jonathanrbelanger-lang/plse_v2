Of course. You are absolutely right. A project isn't complete without a good README.md. It's the front door for any user or contributor.

Based on everything we've built, here is a comprehensive README.md file that explains the project's purpose, its new architecture, and how to use and extend it.

Action for You:

In the root of your plse_v2 repository, create a new file named README.md.

# Python Latent Space Explorer (PLSE) v2.0

PLSE v2.0 is a completely redesigned synthetic code generation engine for creating high-quality, instruction-tuned datasets for Large Language Model (LLM) training.

This project is the result of a critical analysis of a prior script, rebuilt from the ground up to address foundational flaws and establish a robust, scalable, and extensible architecture. It moves beyond a small set of static examples to a powerful combinatorial system capable of generating thousands of unique and valid code snippets.

## Key Features

This version represents a fundamental architectural overhaul, focusing on quality, scalability, and developer experience.

*   **Combinatorial Generation**: Replaces a rigid template system with a flexible combinatorial engine. Patterns are defined with `binding_pools`, allowing for the on-the-fly generation of thousands of unique code variations from a single template.
*   **Modular, File-Based Patterns**: All pattern definitions are externalized into human-readable `.yaml` files located in the `patterns/` directory. The system is no longer monolithic, making it easy to add, modify, or remove patterns without touching the core Python code.
*   **Multi-Stage Validation Pipeline**: A rigorous, fail-fast validation pipeline ensures the quality of every generated sample. It includes:
    1.  **Syntax Validation**: Checks for basic syntactic correctness (`ast.parse`).
    2.  **Style & Linting**: Enforces PEP 8 and catches simple errors (`flake8`).
    3.  **Deep Code Analysis (Optional)**: Scans for "code smells" and deeper issues (`pylint`).
    4.  **Safe Execution**: Executes the code in an isolated process with a timeout to prevent infinite loops from crashing the generator.
*   **Robust Instruction Labeling**: The fragile, keyword-based pattern identification system has been completely removed. The new engine uses the exact bindings from the generation step to create a specific, accurate, and descriptive instruction for each code snippet, guaranteeing a perfect one-to-one mapping.
*   **Critical Bug Fixes**: Corrects major architectural flaws from the original script, including implementing the unused `requires` field to handle imports and providing robust exception handling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8 or newer.

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the root directory (`plse_v2/`).
3.  Install the project and its dependencies using `pip`. This command reads the `pyproject.toml` file and handles everything for you.

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

## Usage

The primary entry point for generating a dataset is the `main.py` script.

1.  **Configure the run**: Open `main.py` and adjust the configuration variables at the top of the `main()` function:
    *   `PATTERNS_DIR`: The directory where your patterns are located (default: `"patterns"`).
    *   `OUTPUT_FILE`: The name of the dataset file to be created (default: `"training_dataset.jsonl"`).
    *   `NUM_EXAMPLES_TO_GENERATE`: The target number of valid code samples for your dataset.
    *   `USE_PYLINT_VALIDATOR`: Set to `True` for the highest quality output, but be aware it will significantly slow down generation speed. Defaults to `False`.

2.  **Run the generator**: Execute the script from your terminal.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

The script will initialize the system, load all patterns, and begin the generate-validate-format loop. Progress will be printed to the console, and the final dataset will be saved to the specified output file in JSON Lines format.

## How to Extend PLSE (Adding New Patterns)

The new architecture makes adding new patterns incredibly simple.

1.  **Create a New YAML File**: In the `patterns/` directory, create a new file (e.g., `my_new_pattern.yaml`).

2.  **Define Your Pattern**: Follow the structure of the `CombinatorialPattern` dataclass. A minimal template is provided below:

    ```yaml
    # patterns/my_new_pattern.yaml

    name: "unique_pattern_name"
    category: "OOP" # Must be a valid category from PatternCategory Enum
    complexity: 2
    requires:
      - "math"     # List any libraries that need to be imported

    template: |
      # Your multi-line Python code template goes here.
      # Use {placeholders} for parts you want to vary.
      import math

      def {func_name}(radius):
          """{description}"""
          return {factor} * math.pi * radius**2

    binding_pools:
      # Define the lists of possible values for each placeholder.
      func_name:
        - "calculate_area"
        - "compute_circle_area"

      description:
        - "Calculates the area of a circle."
        - "Computes the area of a circle given its radius."

      factor:
        - "1.0" # A valid circle area
        - "2.0" # An invalid one (for testing validation)
    ```

3.  **Run the Generator**: That's it! The next time you run `python main.py`, the `PatternRegistry` will automatically discover, load, and start using your new pattern in the generation process.
